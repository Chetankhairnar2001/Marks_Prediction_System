# Marks Prediction System
Self-regulated Student performance prediction is an important job because of the large volume of data generated in educational databases. These methods must be used for knowing students and their learning environment well. The educational institutions are most peculiar about the number of students who will pass/fail for considerable arrangements. The machine learning techniques help to predict student performance well in advance, so that the corrective majors have been taken to improve it. Student academic performance is influenced by various attributes like previous semester/year grades, their demographic details, family background etc. The proposed Students Academic Performance Prediction System, is based on supervised learning Multiple Linear Regression. In support of it, an ensemble method is applied to ameliorate the performance of the classifier, Also the ensemble methods approach is designed to solve regression, prediction and classification problems.
